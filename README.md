# ProjectPyramid
Made by Bogdan Bondarenko, Angus Poole, and Cody Welch.

You should be able to simply run PPP.exe and launch the game. If you would prefer to open it in Unity for yourself, then you can do so.
The Project folder (for opening in Unity) should just be ProjectPyramid.
Please note the game may have also kept the highscore from testing.

Controls:
- WASD to move
- Spacebar to shoot a magic fireball
